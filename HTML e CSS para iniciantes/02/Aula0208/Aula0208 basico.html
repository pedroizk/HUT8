            We started learning about selectors, how you can define multiple characteristics to multiple <br>
            elements just by calling them and separating by a common. -> h1, p {colo: black ...} <br>
            Then, we learned about inside selectors. Example -> <a>select just the 'a' that are inside a 'p'</a>;
            <br><br>
            Selectors by ID ---- <h4 id = "logo">Teste ID (they are unique)</h4> 
            Selector by classes ---- <h4 class="classe1">Teste classe (Do not need to be unique)</h4>
            One element can have more than 1 class...
